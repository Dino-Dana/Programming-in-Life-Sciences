# Neurodegenerative Diseases: Alzheimer’s and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) — Gene Analysis
This project collects genes involved in Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and allows visualization of the physical interactions of the proteins encoded by these genes.
All of this is displayed via a web page whose structure consists of an HTML file, a JavaScript file, and a CSS file.

# Technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

# Web page content
The web page contains two clickable bar graphs that redirect users to a website about the gene in question, two protein networks and their physical interactions, and explanations in text form.

# How to run the file ?
Once the file has been downloaded, simply open the HTML file to view the web page.
It is important to keep the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files in the same folder so that they remain connected.
