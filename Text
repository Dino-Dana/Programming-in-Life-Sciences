    Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involve progressive neuronal loss driven by both genetic and environmental factors (De Strooper & Karran, 2016; Taylor et al., 2016). Our tool provides accessible information on genes associated with these diseases to support individuals and researchers seeking insight into the disorders.

Because many neurodegenerative disorders are proteinopathies, aggregation of disease-related proteins accelerates degeneration. In AD, proteins such as amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and reelin contribute to pathways affecting amyloid accumulation (Selkoe & Hardy, 2016). Similarly, in ALS, aggregation of key proteins such as CACNA1C drive motor neuron degeneration (Van Den Bosch et al., 2006).

<p> These gene networks illustrate how Alzheimer’s disease and ALS arise from disruptions in interconnected molecular pathways. In AD, proteins such as APP, reelin, and CD33 influence amyloid processing and neuroinflammation (Selkoe & Hardy, 2016). In ALS, proteins like CACNA1C contribute to altered calcium signaling and motor neuron vulnerability (Van Den Bosch et al., 2006). Visualizing these relationships highlights how gene-encoded proteins shape disease mechanisms across both disorders. </p>
